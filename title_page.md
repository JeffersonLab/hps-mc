This Doxygen website is used for documenting the hps-mc source code, with the exception of the event generators and stdhep-lib that are not original to this project and documented elsewhere.

### Documented files
This website contains the documentation of the python [job framework](@ref jobframework) and [scripts](@ref jobscripts), as well as the [stdhep-tools](@ref stdheptools) written in C++.
For additional information of how to use the job scripts, refer to the examples directory and [the comments in there](@ref examples).
The [prod](@ref prod) directory is used to organize all scripts that are used to produce and analyze (MC) data. 

#### External documentation
The generators and stdhep-lib are documented in the following places:
- [egs5 manual](https://rcwww.kek.jp/research/egs/egs5_manual/slac730-160113.pdf)
- [madgraph wiki](https://cp3.irmp.ucl.ac.be/projects/madgraph)
- [madgraph documentation by CERN](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/MadgraphTutorial)
