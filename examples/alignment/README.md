alignment {#alignment}
==============
Generally, alignment occurs with several iterations of tracking and parameter optimization.
Below, is an outline on how to do a single iteration of this procedure.

### 1. Run Tracking
This is done with the \ref trackingalign example in this directory.
Edit the list of input files to include the `slcio` files you wish to use for alignment.

### 2. Run pede, Apply Parameters, and Construct Detector
This is done within the \ref pede example in this directory.
Edit `job.json` to include the list of all `bin` files generated by hps-java during step 1.
This step runs the pede minimizer to "optimize" the alignment parameters and then
writes a new iteration of the detector including these updated parameters.

```
cd pede
hps-mc-job run -d $PWD/scratch pede job.json
```
