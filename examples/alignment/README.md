alignment {#alignment}
==============
Generally, alignment occurs with several iterations of tracking and parameter optimization.
Below, is an outline on how to do a single iteration of this procedure.

### 1. Run Tracking
This is done with the \ref trackingalign example in this directory.
Edit the list of input files to include the `slcio` files you wish to use for alignment,
the `job.json.templ` to change the steering file (or other "static" parameters),
and the `vars.json` file to list parameter options you wish the jobs to include.

First, we generate a list of jobs to run tracking over. The files are separated into
different jobs so that they could be run in parallel on a batch system.
```
hps-mc-job-template \
  -j 1 \ # one job per each combination of inputs
  -a tracking/vars.json \ # extra variables to supply to jinja template engine
  -i events tracking/events.txt 1 \ # inputs: NAME FILE_LIST NUM_PER_JOB
  tracking/job.json.templ \ # template job JSON
  tracking_jobs.json # output file to write jobs to
```

Then we run this list of jobs. In this example, there is only one file we are
running tracking over, so we just run the single job directly.
```
hps-mc-job run \
  -d $PWD/scratch \ # choose running/working/scratch directory
  java \ # job to run
  tracking_jobs.json \ # list of jobs to pull from
  -i 1 # job ID number to run
```

Alternatively, the list of jobs (a.k.a. a "job store") could be provided to
a batch system. For example, we can run the different tracking jobs via slurm
when working at SLAC.
```
hps-mc-batch slurm
```

### 2. Run pede, Apply Parameters, and Construct Detector
This is done within the \ref pede example in this directory.
Edit `job.json` to include the list of all `bin` files generated by hps-java during step 1.
This step runs the pede minimizer to "optimize" the alignment parameters and then
writes a new iteration of the detector including these updated parameters.

```
hps-mc-job run \
  -c pede/.hpsmc \ # extra configuration for pede job
  -d $PWD/scratch \ # choose scratch directory
  pede pede/job.json
```
