 * \page wabgensample wab\_gen\_sample
 * 
 * This is an example of how to use the wab\_gen\_sample\_job. The job generates wab events using MadGraph4 and transforms the output from lhe to stdhep to then rotate the events into beam coordinates and sample them using a poisson distribution, calculating mu from provided cross section
 * 
 * \section params Job parameters
 * There are no special run parameters that need to be set for this job other than the general ones discussed on the \ref examples "examples main page".
