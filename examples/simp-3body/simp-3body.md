SIMP-3Body Generation
=====================

This is an example of how to use the `simp-3body` MadGraph generator.
The job generates SIMP events using MadGraph5 having the dark vector meson
undergo a 3-body decay rather than a resonant 2-body decay.

#### Job parameters
The parameters for this generation are the same for the 2-body decay generation.
