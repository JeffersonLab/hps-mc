stdhep-tools {#stdheptools}
============

The stdhep-tools implement a set of tools needed to manipulate the simulated events. This includes for example functions to rotate events into beam coordinates and add information on the mother particle in decays. These tools are used by the job components defined in `python/hpsmc`.
