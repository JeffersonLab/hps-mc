Job scripts {#jobscripts}
===========

All job scripts are saved in the `python/jobs` directory. Here, the naming convention is to include `_job` at the end of every file name to ensure that the files are processed correctly when hps-mc is built.

For more information on how to use the job scripts, refer to the examples directory and @ref examples.
